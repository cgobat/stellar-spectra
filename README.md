# Inferring Stellar Distances Using Optical Spectroscopy
## Design and Implementation of a Python-Based Engine to Parse and Analyze Stellar Spectra from the SDSS Catalog

A fitting engine that uses photometric observations of stars by SDSS to infer their distance from Earth.

To run, download the files in the repository. Make sure that the .csv and the two .pkl files are in the same directory as the IPython notebook, or else modify the code to reference their actual locations.
